# pasteboard
System tray program to keep a history of the system buffer which called '[pasteboards](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/PasteboardGuide106/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008100-SW1)' in OS X.

To try the pre-release version you can [download](https://github.com/iharsuvorau/pasteboard/releases/download/0.1/pastebord-0.1_darwin64.zip) the binary and run it from the terminal:
```
./pasteboard
```

You'll see a system tray icon 'Pb'. By clicking on it, it will show a list of buffers. The maximum buffers amount is 20 for now. Clicking on a buffer makes it active so you can paste it.
